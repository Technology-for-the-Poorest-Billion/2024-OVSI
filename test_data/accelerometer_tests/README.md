# Test data

The `.xlsx` files in this folder contain all of the data that was collected during the tests that were performed for the interim report. The file names are constructed with the following naming convention:
- The first part of the name shows the concentrator that the accelerometer was attached to
- The second part shows whether or not the concentrator with the accelerometer attached was turned on or off
- The rest of the name relates to the particular test being performed

Here is an explanation of each test:
- 'No noise' means that the output was recorded in quiet conditions
- 'Touching' means that another concentrator was turned on and placed in direct contact with the concentrator being measured
- '10cm away' means that another concentrator was turned on and placed 10cm away from the concentrator being measured
- 'Trolley and walking' explains the sources of noise that were present during testing
- 'Uneven ground' shows the test results when the concentrator was left on uneven ground

Finally, the `comparison_of_test_data.xlsx` contains a quick comparison of all of the above results in the form of bar charts, as can be found in the interim report.
