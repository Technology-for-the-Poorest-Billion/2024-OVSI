### AB 16/05/24
- Acquired 4 Nucleo-144 F746ZG microcontrollers
- Did full chip erase and updated firmware to ensure they would run properly
- Judged the use of VS Code and PlatformIO as the best way to program the microcontrollers using open source software
- Did some basic programming using the LED lights to ensure I could sync the microcontroller and my laptop
- Used preprocessor directives to conditionally compile code based on using unique identifiers for each board
- Used the serial monitor to print a continuous output based off button presses
- Ordered one accelerometer, one microphone and an electronics kit with a breadboard

### HA 17/05/24
- Researched use cases of non intrusive load monitoring with accelerometers.
- Assessed feasability for use on an oxygen concentrator.
- Made a list of necessary hardware and did a cost estimation per unit.
- Made an account of software required to process raw vibration data.
- Found modifications required for acoustic sensor.
- Brief familiarisation with sensors and microctrollers we have / have on order.
