# OVSI Final Output folder

This folder contains all of the handover notes to be given to Ben and the team at OVSI. This contains a summary of the project, with all the required aspects covered to understand and recreate the prototype. 

Below is a brief explanation of what is contained in each folder:
- `1_prototype_demonstration` contains a demonstration of all functions of the final prototype.
- `2_hardware_and_circuitry` contains the breadboard layout and information on the sensor attachments, including the STL file for the 3D-printed clips.
- `3_code` contains both the Micropython code for the Pi Pico and Python code for reading the output of the sensors through the serial port, and converting it into a live interface.
- `4_further_considerations` contains a markdown document for suggestion for the next steps of the project, including ideas for refinement of the prototype, and further research that could be conducted.
- `5_testing_results` contains the results of the tests performed on the accelerometer and microphone used in producing the final prototype.
