- `Further_considerations` contains a markdown document for next steps of the project
- `Hardware_and_circuitry` contains the breadboard layout and information on the sensor attachment, including the STL file for the clips
- `Testing` contains the results of the tests performed on the accelerometer and microphone used to refine the final prototype
- `prototype_demonstration` contains a demonstration of all functions of the prototypoe in its final state, showing the outputs and its discrimination against interference
