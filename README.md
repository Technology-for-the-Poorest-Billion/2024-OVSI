# OVSI Usage Monitoring Project

The Oxygen and Ventilator System Initiative (OVSI) "wants to ensure every individual has reliable and equitable access to essential medical oxygen". One of their key innovation domains is in developing a remote monitoring system that can integrate with all types of existing concentrators to track usage and schedule preventive maintenance. Our project looks at doing early stage testing relating to the various different sensors that could be used, and attempting to develop an early prototype. The output from this mini-project should help to give preliminary results and insights into the viablility of the different routes that could be taken to develop a non-invasive monitoring device.

Below is a brief explanation of what is contained in each folder:
- `project_proposal` contains both the project proposal and project management information
- `interim_report` contains a markdown document containing the interim report for this project
- `final_output` contains documentation of the project output, all other folders serve to report interim progress and sensor testing 
- `code` contains all code used throughout the project. It has folders for both the Micropython code used with a Pi Pico and the Python code for reading the output from various sensors through the serial port.
- `test_data` contains all of the datasets and results from any testing we performed
- `www` contains the markdown documents which are converted into HTML for a website
