# Microphone with Insulation Test Data

All tests were performed with the microphone attached to the blue Everflo oxygen concentrator.
The tests performed were as follows:
- `blue_on_foam` recording the output when the blue concentrator was turned on with no noise in the background
- `no_noise_foam` recording the output when the blue concentrator was turned off and with no noise in the background
- `random_noise_foam` recording the output when there was noise from walking, talking, clapping etc
- `black_on_near_blue_foam` recording the output when the black concentrator was on and running roughly 10cm from the blue concentrator
