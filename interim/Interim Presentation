# Interim Presentation

### Work have we achieved to date
- Background reading of other similar applications of NILM. 
- Settled on our most promising idea for achieving operation monitoring using vibrations.
- Connected accelerometer to microcontroller.
- Written code to read and manipulate accelerometer data.
- Connected LED circuit to give visual reading. 
- 3D printed mounting solution for breadboard. 
- Tested vibrations under variety of external factors to influence threshold and measurement approach.
- Data analysis of vibration readings.
- Updated code to give accurate readings in presence of external factors.

### Updated project development timeline 

- Week 1: Understanding the problem and identifying potential solutions.
- Week 2: Setup of vibration monitoring prototype and successful testing. 
- Week 3: Sound monitoring feasability test, refinement of vibration prototype. 
- Week 4: Documenting our invisiged next steps for the company. Project deliverables.

Slight reshuffle due to a delay in sound sensor arriving but overall ahead of schedule.

### Plan for project completion 

- 2 days max testing microphone as it will likely be highly innacurate but worth ruling out with concrete testing. 
- Further analysis of test data for vibrations to set design threshold. 
- Finalise prototype with LED to show operation. 
- Run longer timeframe test to establish accuracy.
