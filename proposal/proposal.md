# Problem description

Brief overview of the problem, context and engineering approach to tackle the problem.

"Pneumonia kills more children than any other infectious disease, claiming the lives of over 700,000 children under five every year... almost all of these deaths are preventable" - UNICEF [2023]. However, it has been shown that in countries with robust oxygen systems, hospital-based pneumonia deaths can be reduced by half. One of the main challenges for Ministries of Health is in collecting meaningful data about the usage of oxygen concentrators, which would help them identify the needs and gaps of oxygen supplies in their country. A simple, low-cost and reliable device that could be used to measure the usage of any commercially available oxygen concentrator would be a huge benefit to biomedical engineers and Ministries of Health.

# Presentation of the proposal

The first stage of the project will be to test various sensors to determine the best way to measure whether an oxygen concentrator is either running or turned off.

# Assessment of the quality of the proposal

Evaluate its value in the context of the project. What will it solve, is it safe, etc. Check Laraâ€™s slides for what to cover.

Non-invasive - meet standards and regulations
Collaboratively co-created - speak to the end users
Enhance agency - manage and maintain the technology independently
Low cost - must consider capex, opex and potential savings
Context appropriate - robust, reliable and easy to repair
Existing ecosystems - must be able to fit in with the current infrastructure
