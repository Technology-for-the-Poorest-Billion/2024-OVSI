# Problem description

Brief overview of the problem, context and engineering approach to tackle the problem.

"Pneumonia kills more children than any other infectious disease, claiming the lives of over 700,000 children under five every year... almost all of these deaths are preventable" - UNICEF [2023]. It has been shown that in countries with robust oxygen systems, hospital-based pneumonia deaths can be reduced by half. However, due to the harsh operating environment in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia where Pneumonia is most prevalent, these oxygen concentrators often fail to operate reliably.

One of the main challenges for Ministries of Health is in collecting meaningful data about the usage of oxygen concentrators, which would help them to identify the needs and gaps of oxygen supplies in their country.

A simple, low-cost and reliable device that could be implemented to measure the usage of any commercially available oxygen concentrator would be a huge benefit to biomedical engineers and Ministries of Health.

# Presentation of the proposal

The first stage of the project will be to test various sensors to determine the best way to measure whether an oxygen concentrator is either running or turned off.

# Assessment of the quality of the proposal

Evaluate its value in the context of the project. What will it solve, is it safe, etc. Check Laraâ€™s slides for what to cover.

**Non-invasive** - the device should be non-invasive in nature so that it easily meets the strict European standards and regulations that are set around the use of medical devices.  
**Collaboratively co-created** - 
**Enhance agency** - the device should give better control to biomedical technicians and Ministries of Health over the effective use of oxygen concentrators and ensure that they will be able to manage and maintain the technology independently.  
**Low cost** - the design process must consider the initial cost (capex), the operating cost (opex), but also the potential savings from the introduction of a simple and efficient monitoring system.  
**Context appropriate** - the device should be robust, reliable and easy to repair with consideration to the specific environemental conditions it will face.  
**Existing ecosystems** - the device must be designed in such a way that all of its functionality, from the way that it is powered to the way that it stores and transfers data, must be able to fit in with the existing infrastructure.
