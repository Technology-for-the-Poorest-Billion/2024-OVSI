# Problem description

"Pneumonia kills more children than any other infectious disease, claiming the lives of over 700,000 children under five every year... almost all of these deaths are preventable" - UNICEF [2023]. It has been shown that in countries with robust oxygen systems, hospital-based pneumonia deaths can be reduced by half. However, due to the harsh operating environment in Sub-Saharan Africa and South East Asia where Pneumonia is most prevalent, these oxygen concentrators often fail to operate reliably.

One of the main challenges for Ministries of Health is in collecting meaningful data about the usage of oxygen concentrators, which would help them to identify the needs and gaps of oxygen supplies in their country.

A simple, low-cost and reliable device that could be implemented to measure the usage of any commercially available oxygen concentrator would be a huge benefit to biomedical engineers and Ministries of Health. It would allow for better management and allocation of oxygen concentrators throughout a region, to ensure that all concentrators are being used to maximal effect.

# Presentation of the proposal

This project aims to design a reliable and non-invasive monitoring device that is capable of recording the operational status of an oxygen concentrator and that is suitable for use in low-resource settings. The main aims of the project will be to:

- test various sensors and evaluate their effectiveness given the context that the device will be used in, in order to determine the best choice for the given requirements.  
- design how the monitoring device will attach onto the oxygen concentrators. There are multiple different brands of concentrators all with slightly varying design, and the device should be made to be compatable with all versions without the need for alterations.   
- investigate the existing infrastructure in the countries that this device is being designed for and then research a suitable method for collecting and trasnferring the data to the relevant people.

# Assessment of the quality of the proposal

**Standards and Regulations** - the device should be non-invasive in nature so that it easily meets the strict European standards and regulations that surround the use of medical devices.  
**Collaboratively co-created** - the design process should involve all the stakeholders - particularly the end-users - to ensure that the device is both culturally and contextually appropriate.  
**Enhance agency** - the device should give better control to biomedical technicians and Ministries of Health over the effective use of oxygen concentrators and ensure that they will be able to manage and maintain the technology independently.  
**Low cost** - the design process must consider the initial cost (capex), the operating cost (opex), but also the potential monetary savings from the introduction of a simple and efficient monitoring system.  
**Context appropriate** - the device should be robust, reliable and easy to repair with consideration to the specific environemental conditions it will face.  
**Existing ecosystems** - the device must be designed in such a way that all of its functionality, from the way that it is powered to the way that it stores and transfers data, is able to fit in with the existing infrastructure.
