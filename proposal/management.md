# Project Management Plan


## The people

Harry Antill & Alex Beeston

**Strengths:**
- Mechanical and materials engineering. 
- Previous project experience together.

**Weaknesses:**
- Electrical and software engineering.
- Small team.

**Skills Required:**
- Critical understanding of the cultural and operational environment where the technology is needed.
- Ability to work with various stakeholders from different backgrounds.
- Analytical skills to judge the effectiveness of solutions.
- Ability to create rapid prototypes and quickly assess functionality. 
- Programming and understanding of data storage and transfer.
- Project management skills (resource coordination and risk management).
- Technical writing and presentation skills.

**Training Needed:**
- GitHub.
- Microcontrollers and sensors.
- Data storage and transfer processes.
- Potentially CAD modelling.
- Potentially 3D printing.

## The resources needed

**From Ben Moore:**
- Oxygen Concentrator (1 or 2).
- Sensors and other assortment of parts for testing of physical solutions.

**Externally Sourced:**

Will evolve as ideas are refined but likely to include:
- Sensors.
- Casing parts.
- 3D printed housing.
- Bolts and other joining componenets.
- Cheap basic microcontroller.
- Wiring and solder metal.

Total budget likely in region of Â£100. 

## The timeline

**Tasks:**
- Week 1: Understanding the problem and identifying potential solutions.
- Week 2: Initial testing of most promosing ideas.
- Week 3: Tangible soluition to usage monitoring with testing and modifications.
- Week 4: Data storage and transfering in the developing world (theoretical).

## The assessment of the risks and safety

**Risks:**
- Tools used for physical manufacture can be sharp. Mitigated by using suitable protective equipment.
- Live electrical components. Do not make changes whilst connected to the power source.
- Transport of large oxygen concentrator machines. Lift in pairs where necessary. 


## Contengency plans

**Potential Pitfalls**
- Prototype of solution is not achievable within timeframe. 
- Oxygen concentrators and sensors not recieved from Ben until late into the project. 

**How to overcome**
- If prototype not achievable then have CAD model and rigorous optioneering document to give insight into the best apporach to the problem.
- If physcial resources delayed, make CAD model and prepare manufacture plan to streamline process when they do arrive.
